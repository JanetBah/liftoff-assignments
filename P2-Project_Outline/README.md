## Submission Instructions

Overview: This app will be for users who would like to learn how to dance but are either shy or afraid to dance in front of people because they do not know what to do once they are in the Latin dance scene. The users will be able to use the app through a free version and learn foundation moves of the dance style they choose, and advance at their own pace. The idea came from my experience with friends who love to go out dancing, but feel intimidated once they get to the dance floor because they have no idea what is happening.

Features:
Home Page: users will be able to learn what the app is all about on this page. The homepage will have 2 options for the user to get started in the process, and already have an account option that they can go straight to their profile.

Register Page: Users will be able to see the different classes or dance styles available in the app for them to choose from. They will get to choose one dance style at a time. After choosing a style, the user will get to choose a path meaning Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced path. Then will get prompted to create a profile to make it easy to track their progress within the class.
Search: users will be able to search for topics, and dance classes within their path.
Metrics: users will be able to see their progress on this page which will show what class is ongoing, and completed classes.
Discussion page: users will be able to interact with each other on this page of the application. Share their experience, encourage each other etc.

Technologies
Javascript
C#
MySQL


What I’ll have to learn:

-How to use javascript for front-end and utilize C# and MySQL database structure in the app. I am thinking on having building a dynamic website and use C# structure with buttons and forms on the website.

-How to integrate youtube videos for the dance style classes into my application. Since I won’t be making the classes myself, I still want them to be high quality videos.
